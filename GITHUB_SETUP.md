# GitHub Setup Instructions

1. Go to GitHub (https://github.com) and sign in to your account.
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'.
3. Name your repository 'MedReminder'.
4. Choose to make it public or private as per your preference.
5. Do not initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license.
6. Click 'Create repository'.

After creating the repository, follow these steps in your Replit terminal:

1. Verify that your files are committed:
   ```
   git status
   ```
   You should see a message saying "nothing to commit, working tree clean".

2. Set the remote URL (replace 'username' with your GitHub username):
   ```
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/MedReminder.git
   ```

3. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. When prompted for authentication:
   - For the username, enter your GitHub username.
   - For the password, use your GitHub personal access token (GITHUB_TOKEN).

5. Verify that your code has been pushed to GitHub by visiting your repository page:
   https://github.com/username/MedReminder

6. If you encounter any issues, make sure:
   - You've replaced 'username' with your actual GitHub username in the remote URL.
   - You're using the correct personal access token (GITHUB_TOKEN).
   - Your personal access token has the necessary permissions (repo, workflow).

After completing these steps, your MedReminder app should be successfully pushed to your GitHub repository.
